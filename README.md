These are my coding works.

Short introduction to these small, but rather useful apps.

(In order of usefulness)

R6 Sensitivity Calculator: There was a sensitivity rewamp in R6 in 2020, this app helps you to switch from the old system to the new. Has 4 popular presets, available in English
and Hungarian both, communicates with the game itself, so you dont have to import the new sensitivity manually. Saves your profile.

R6 Server Switcher: This app lets you switch R6 region/server outside the game. Feauters a light and a darkmode. It communicates with the game itself, so you dont have to
import the selected server manually. Saves your profile.

runCheck: This app's purpose is to replace NVIDIA Shadowplay or other not-so-reliable instant replay sowftwares with the good old OBS Studio. If this app is running in the
background (most likely from system start), then it will start OBS with custom launch options (such as start replay capturing) WHEN RainbowSix.exe (or _Vulkan.exe) is launched.

Stream Bookmark: This app will save logs of a streams, create events when you press Printscreen. You can easily clip your best moments afterwards without putting a huge
load on your CPU or GPU.

vmix-macro.ahk: This autohotkey script sends control inputs to vmix64.exe even when the production app is not the focused window. 

justChatting: This app is a 100% secure, peer-to-peer chat system, featuring only two partys: the sender and the reciever.

Alpha pack calculator: This app will calculate how many alphapacks you can buy with the amount of in-game currency you posses. You can select wether you own Year Pass or not.

Situation macro: This app will run in the background, and if set up correctly, will create an infinite R6 single-player loop, so your PC will automatically farm you in-game
currency while you're sleeping or aren't home.
